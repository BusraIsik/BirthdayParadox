# BirthdayParadox

The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room will have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of people in the room, is more than 23. 
This paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays, which test this paradox for n = 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 people in room.
